# NodeLab GUI

## Runing development server

Run `brunch watch --server` and then navigate to [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333). You may also consider using [Pow](http://pow.cx) for running webserver separately.

### Running incremental linker

To use GHCI mode with incremental linker (aka very fast rebuild) please run `brunch watch --server --env interactive`. This environment has major advantage: [Save] to running new code in the browser time is very short: few seconds vs. more than minute. However, it has some limitations: only one browser may be connected do GHCJSi server, when new browser connects the old one will be kicked from the session.

In interactive mode, the page is reloaded upon file save, however new code is injected a couple of seconds later. In the meantime you'll see console of GHCJSi containing build log redirected to the browser.

### Setup and usage of incremental linker

1. `cd ~/.ghcjs/x86_64-*-0.2.0.20160517-7.10.3/ghcjs`
2. `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kfigiela/ghcjs-brunch/stack/irunner.js`
3. `cd ~/nbo/new_byte_order/nodelab`
4. `brunch watch -e interactive --server`
5. `curl -s http://localhost:9886/reload` - typechecking (it's also done automatically after saving any file)
6. `curl -s http://localhost:9886/link` - update js files (if you don't like seeing errors add `2>/dev/null`)
7. `curl -s http://localhost:9886/restart` - restart ghci (if you have troubles)

## Dev-env setup

```
# Use system specific tool in place of brew
brew install pkg-config
brew install zeromq
brew install supervisor
# export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" # put to .zshrc or equivalent
stack install alex happy hpack
git clone git@bitbucket.org:NewByteOrder/new_byte_order.git
cd new_byte_order/
git submodule update --init --recursive
scripts/gencabal
cd nodelab/
stack setup
sudo npm install -g brunch bower
bower install
npm install
```

Be aware that the newest `node.js` version may not work in this setup (downgrade to 5.9.1).
Program hsc2hs must be in PATH.

## Building

Follow instructions:
```
brunch build               # development build
brunch build -e production # production build
brunch watch --server      # build and watch changes
```

## Supervisor - handling backend

```
cd new_byte_order/supervisor
supervisord
supervisorctl status all
supervisorctl restart all
supervisorctl tail -f luna-empire
```

## Building for production

Run `brunch build --production`. `--production` flag enables JS minification (this will take a while). It also disables overriding feature-switches from `localStorage`.

## Feature switches

Feature switches reside in `app/features.default.js`. These values are for production environment. You can override them for development by creating file `app/features.local.js` (listed in `.gitignore`) or by setting `localStorage.[feature_name] = "true|false"` in web browser. Overrides are ignored in production build.

## Tips

* App outputs to browser console build time and Git hash (with prefix "-local" if it had non-commited changes).
* You may want to change `plugins.ghcjs.buildCommand` to `cabal build` to speedup compilation (at least it speeds on my Mac). `plugins.ghcjs.clearScreen` may ba also useful â€“ it clears terminal when building Haskell sources. This is useful in combination with iTerm2 CMD+Click on file path in error messages.
* JS dependencies are managed by Bower (at least one present in bower repos)
* `three-bmfont-text` is designed to be NPM/browserify package. I've built dist package with `cjsify index.js --export THREE_TEXT --ignore-missing > three-bmfont-text-cjs.js`
* GHCJS should be installed with following instructions: https://gist.github.com/kfigiela/b908c44d6203b72e3739#file-install-ghcjs-sh

## Local `brunch-config` overrides

It's possible to override some brunch settings locally by creating file `brunch-config.local.coffee` that exports function `transform` that modifies config. Example:

```coffee
exports.transform = (config) ->
  config.plugins.ghcjs.buildCommand = "stack build"
  config.plugins.ghcjs.clearScreen  = true
```
